# Security Graph - Intel API

## Security Graph

Security Graph is a data architecture that provides real-time views of assets
and their relationships. Assets to be considered include software, cloud
resources and, in general, any piece of information that a security team needs
to protect.

Security Graph not only stores the catalog of active assets and the assets
assigned to teams. It also keeps a historical log of the multidimensional
relationships among these assets, including their attributes relevant to
security.
